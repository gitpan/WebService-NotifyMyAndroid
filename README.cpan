A couple of the cpan module have dependencies on libraries being installed

# Net::SSLeay

This is a sub-dependency of LWP::Protocol::https and requires 'libssl-dev' to
install.

On a debian/ubuntu machine this can be resolved by running:

    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

# XML::Parser

This is a sub-dependency of WebService::Simple and required 'libexpat-dev' to
install.

    sudo apt-get install install libexpat-dev
